# Exploring The Rigel Star
#### By Ethan Oles on 2/5/2024
Recently I went on a trip to look at the Rigel Star. From my home planet Earth this is the seventh largest star that is visible.<br/> To get there we took a space jet that travels at the speed of light. The trip normally takes 864 Earth years which is very long. <br/> To combat this issue our jet was equipped with a time travel and anti-aging device. This allowed us to safely jump <br/> 864 years in the future and make it to the star in five minutes.<br/><br/>

Once we got to the star I was very impressed with how beautiful it was. The blue color of the star was very unique and I had <br/>never seen something like it before. When looking at the star we had to protect our eyes with our star glasses. These glasses<br/> made sure our vision would not be damaged from the star's brightness. <br/><br/>

In the journey to get back to Earth, we went around the whole star. I was very suprised with how large this star was compared to <br/>the sun as it is about 70 times larger. After seeing the star one final time, we were ready to head back to Earth. In order <br/>to do so we had to go back in time 864 years. Five minutes later we had arrived back on Earth and the trip was completed.<br/> This was a great experience and I would love to go back some time.
