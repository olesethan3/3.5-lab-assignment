# My Experience on Kepler 452b
#### By Ethan Oles on 2/5/2024
Since I am from the planet Earth I have always been fascinated with Kepler 452b. I have heard that it is similar to Earth and was <br/> curious how similar it actually was. So I decided to go on a trip to look more into the planet. This trip was even farther <br/>than the Rigel Star as it takes 1,800 Earth years to get there. In order to get there very quickly we used a space jet<br/> equipped with time travel. This allowed us to travel 1,800 years in the future safely.<br/><br/>
However once we arrived I noticed that I could not move my legs. In which the pilot explained that this could happen as a side<br/> effect of the rapid time travel. He then used a spray on my legs which reversed the effects and allowed me to move my legs<br/> again. After solving this problem we were finally about to walk onto the surface of Kepler 452b.<br/><br/>

We were required to wear special equipment to protect our bodies as they were not suitable to survive on the planet in this time<br/> period. Once we arrived on the planet I was very suprised with how the weather was there. It was only 75 degres<br/> farenheight, which was 10 degrees warmer than Earth at the time. This made me realize why so many people were comparing this<br/> planet to the Earth.<br/><br/>
One main difference I noticed between Kepler and the Earth was that it had many more volcanos. Everywhere I looked I saw<br/> different volcanos, some close and some far. Which explains why we were the only people on the planet at the time. The tours of<br/> Kepler are only given out once a day at certain time period because that is when the volcanos are not active. It provides<br/> reason to why this planet unfortunetly was not habitable by humans at the moment. <br/><br/>

After exploring a litte longer I was able to find a rock to keep as a souvenir. Though it was time to head back to Earth as were<br/> only allowed 30 minutes to explore. This was because Volcanos were starting in 15 minutes. So everyone boarded the jet<br/> and we made our way back to Earth. I had a great time and am happy to check this experience off my bucket list.
